## 🧐 Abstract

The entertainment industry is volatile. Traditional forecasting relies on static historical data (Cast, Budget, Genre), often missing the "pulse" of the audience. **This project bridges that gap.**

We propose a **Hybrid Predictive System** that fuses quantitative metrics with qualitative real-time data. By leveraging **BERT embeddings** for context-aware sentiment analysis of social media (Twitter, YouTube) and **LSTM** for time-series trend forecasting, we provide actionable insights for studios and investors to mitigate financial risk.

### 🌟 Key Capabilities
* **🧠 Context-Aware Sentiment:** Uses **BERT** and **VADER** to analyze social buzz and **LDA** for topic modeling.
* **📈 Precision Regression:** **CatBoost Regressor** predicts opening weekend revenue with **96% R²**.
* **🏷️ Success Classification:** Categorizes films as *Hit*, *Average*, or *Flop* using **Random Forest**.
* **⏳ Trend Forecasting:** **LSTM** networks analyze temporal engagement patterns.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Our pipeline processes unstructured social data alongside structured movie metadata to feed a multi-model ensemble.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Data Collection
    A[Social Media] -->|Twitter/YouTube| C(Unstructured Text)
    B[IMDb / TMDb] -->|Metadata| D(Structured Data)
    end

    subgraph Preprocessing
    C --> E[Cleaning & Normalization]
    E --> F[BERT Embeddings]
    E --> G[LDA Topic Modeling]
    end

    subgraph Hybrid Modeling
    D & F & G --> H{Feature Fusion}
    H --> I[CatBoost Regressor]
    H --> J[Random Forest Classifier]
    H --> K[LSTM Forecaster]
    end

    subgraph Output
    I --> L[Revenue Prediction]
    J --> M[Hit/Flop Verdict]
    K --> N[Trend Analysis]
    end

```
## 📊 Performance & Benchmarks

We rigorously tested our models on a dataset of **10,000 movie records** (80:20 split). The hybrid approach significantly outperforms traditional single-model baselines.

### 2. Revenue Regression Error (Lower is Better)

| Model | MAE (₹ Cr) | RMSE (₹ Cr) | R² Score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| KNN Regressor | 1.8 | 3.5 | 0.89 |
| Decision Tree | 1.5 | 3.0 | 0.92 |
| **CatBoost (Ours)** | **1.1** | **2.2** | **0.96** |

> **Insight:** CatBoost achieved the highest R² (0.96), explaining 96% of the variance in revenue, making it the superior choice for continuous revenue prediction.

### 3. Time Series Forecasting (LSTM vs ARIMA)

| Model | MAPE (%) | RMSE | Verdict |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ARIMA | 7.4% | 13.9 | Traditional statistical method struggles with non-linear trends. |
| GRU | 6.9% | 12.6 | Better than ARIMA but slightly less accurate than LSTM. |
| **LSTM** | **5.2%** | **10.1** | **Deep Learning captures complex temporal patterns effectively.** |

    ```

### Usage Example

```python
from models import HybridPredictor

# Initialize Model with Pre-trained Weights
predictor = HybridPredictor(weights='./checkpoints/rf_catboost_v1.pth')

# Sample Movie Data
movie_data = {
    "title": "Future Blockbuster",
    "budget_crores": 150,
    "genre": "Sci-Fi",
    "social_sentiment_score": 0.85, # Derived from BERT module
    "trailer_views": 2500000
}

# Run Prediction
prediction = predictor.predict(movie_data)

print(f"Predicted Revenue: ₹{prediction['revenue']} Crores")
print(f"Verdict: {prediction['category']}") # Output: Hit
